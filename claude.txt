For the purposes of the below description, the word "LMOS" refers to a proprietary ActiveX control that controls a laser engraving machine. The control reads data in XML format and exposes several methods for controlling the hardware.

The attached files are as follows:

lmosactxlib.h: A C++ header file generated by Qt Activeqt that describes the methods exposed by the LMOS ActiveX control.

lmos.cpp: A C++ file that is part of a Qt project that uses Activeqt to instantiate the LMOS ActiveX control within the Qt project. lmos.cpp 

invokec.c: An example C program that instantiates the LMOS ActiveX control and calls a method that displays an 'about' dialog using pure C.

## Main Objective

The objective is to create a pure C library that performs a similar function to the lmos.cpp file, but without Qt. The library should act as a bridge, allowing the methods of the LMOS ActiveX control to be called from standard C programs, and any LMOS events or messages should be available via simple C callback functions.

The main methods that are required from the lmos.cpp file are:

* The hide and show methods for the control.
* The InitMachine method.
* The ImportXML and SaveXML functions.

Your job is to assist in the implementation of the C library. Even though the C language is not optimal for connecting to an ActiveX control, the use of other languages such as C++ is not an option and you must not attempt to develop the library using C++ or another language.

Your first task is to modify the invokec.c program to implement the equvalent function to the Lmos::LoadXML method of lmos.cpp. This method calls LMOS methods to clear an existing layout, load XML from a file, and display a window.
