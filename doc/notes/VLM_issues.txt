UI Issues
---------

Multiple LP mode can cause the console to lock (all controls greyed out)
easy gui has no undo or save warning
Poor optimisation of graphics when hatched
Accessing properties of multiple items with large paths can cause lockup


General Issues
--------------

Fonts with overlapping letters are not merged and are overmarked.
No ability to calibrate or compensate for rings that are not perfectly circular.
No elliptical bangles.
Can only do inside rings with easy gui as calculation of vector not explained well enough in manual. No wizards to calculate axial vector for tilted cylinder.


Shadows
-------

Does not calculate shadows to miss gaps or prevent under/over marking
Shadow calculation is poor (non-existent in EasyGui). Flipping back and forth between shadow and drawing view changes zoom.
No ability to break rings into circular sections at different heights for marking the inside of wide rings that lose focus.


LMOS Problems
-------------

Imported groups have bounding box issue
Cannot create geometries directly in LMOS - forced to use import
Cannot create or import shadows
Import is missing features:
	local lp sets or local hatch patterns
	full LP parameters
