For the purposes of the below description, the word "LMOS" refers to a
proprietary ActiveX control that controls a laser engraving machine. The
control reads data in XML format and exposes several methods for controlling
the hardware.

The attached files are as follows:

lmosactxlib.h: A C++ header file generated by Qt Activeqt that describes the methods exposed by the LMOS ActiveX control.

lmos.cpp: A C++ file that is part of a Qt project that uses Activeqt to instantiate the LMOS ActiveX control within the Qt project. lmos.cpp 

invokec.c: An example C program that instantiates the LMOS ActiveX control and calls a method that displays an 'about' dialog using pure C.

## Main Objective

The objective is to create a pure C++ library that performs a similar function
to the lmos.cpp file, but without Qt. The library should allow the methods of
the LMOS ActiveX control to be called from standard C and C++ programs, and any
LMOS events or messages should be available via simple callback functions.

The main methods that are required from the lmos.cpp file are:

* The hide and show methods for the control.
* The InitMachine method.
* The ImportXML and SaveXML functions.

Your job is to assist in the implementation of the C++ library.

Your first task is to create an example program to test that the functions have
been implemented correctly. You should take the invokec.c program as an example
of the simple program required. You are to implement the equvalent function to
the Lmos::LoadXML method of lmos.cpp. This method calls LMOS methods to clear
an existing layout, load XML from a file, and display a window.
