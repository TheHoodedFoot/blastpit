The following Python code is an extension for the Inkscape SVG editor. The
code performs the following functions:

* Read variables from the SVG data held in json format.
* Convert the SVG drawing into simple bezier splines by using an external
program 'svgtobezier'
* Read back the converted spline data and process it into XML format
  suitable for the program 'LMOS'
* Group the splines by colour
* Upload the XML data over the network

Examine the code and indicate all areas where it can be improved. Your goal is
to reduce redundancy, optimize the code where possible, and consolidate duplicate code into
functions where possible.
